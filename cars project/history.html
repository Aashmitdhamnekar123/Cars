<h2 style="background-color:rgb(0, 255, 115);color:blue;width: 625px; font-size: 22px; text-align:center;">What was the first car</h2>
<p style="background-color:lime; color:black; width: 625px;font-size: 20px;">On January 29, 1886, Carl Benz applied for a patent for his “vehicle powered by a gas engine.” 
    The patent number 37435 may be regarded as the birth certificate of the automobile. In July 1886 the newspapers reported on the first public outing of the three-wheeled Benz Patent Motor Car,
     model no. 1.</p>
<p style="background-color:lime; color:black; width: 625px;font-size: 20px;"> Benz also patented his own throttle system, spark plugs, gear shifters, a water radiator, a carburetor and other fundamentals to the automobile. Benz eventually built a car company that still exists today as the Daimler Group.</p>
