<h2>INVENTION</h2>
<p >1. Research market, including in-house and field investigations, to identify the role of this product and its components in the global portfolio; define separation from similar models sold by sister brands
    <br>
    2. Identify special features, advantages, and potential world, U.S., or segment firsts
    <br>
    3. Define competitive set, target customers; set curb-weight, fuel-economy, and performance goals
    <br>
    4. Competitive assessment
    <br>
    5. Powertrain selection
    <br>
    6. Budget, funding, pricing, investment considerations
    <br>
    7. Computer-aided-engineering (CAE) analysis
    <br>
    8. Customer, press, analyst clinics
</p>
<h2> DESIGN</h2>
<p>1. Interior—sketches, theme selection, model build, continuous reviews
    <br>
    2. Exterior—same as above until design freeze
    <br>
    3. Exterior colors, interior-trim materials selection
    Wind-tunnel assessment of theme models
    <br>
    4. Concept creation for management presentation, potential auto-show use
    Additional CAE
    <br>
   5. Management and engineering reviews
</p>
<h2>ENGINEERING</h2>
<p>1. Additional CAE<br>
   2.  Customer clinics aimed at gathering current model feedback, suggestions for improvements<br>
    3. Research advanced technologies—engines, transmissions, motors, electronic controls, manufacturing techniques (painting, metal forming, plastic molding), and emerging trends<br>
   4. Package, layout studies<br>
   5. Body design and development for crashworthiness, weight, durability (in conjunction with CAE efforts)<br>
   6.  Aerodynamic development<br>
    7. Design, development, tuning, validation (in-lab and on-road) of:
   a.  Powertrain
   9. Chassis<br>
   10. HVAC, infotainment, seats, lighting systems<br>
   11. Hot-, cold-, wet-weather tests<br>
  12. Crash tests<br>
   13. Fuel-economy evaluations<br>
   14. Design for manufacturing and assembly studies<br>
    15. Component and manufacturing cost analysis<br>
   16. Collaborate with suppliers for R&D of purchased components<br>
    17. Safety and emissions certification <br></p>
